- visuals for number of cracks on tiles
	3 cracks left -> darker blue
	2 cracks left -> darker bleu with cracks on it
	1 crack left -> light bleu
	0 cracks left -> light bleu with cracks on it


Core mechanic -> 1 crack for each tile
-> Introduce multiple cracking (2 and 3)
-> Introduce crack a number of tiles before moving on (even with multiple cracking it's one per tile not per crack)
-> Introduce lever (bring down small obstacles)
-> Introduce key that opens new section in the map
(lever can be used, for example, in a section to make it more difficult to get the key)
later:
-> Introduce crack area around you
-> Introduce timer on cracks when standing on a tile
-> Introduce tiles cracking automatically after some time (gradually from start to finish)

To Do:
- visuals for number of tiles to cracks before door unlocks
- create puzzles
